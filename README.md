## Concerning Levels of Significance - Analysing Methods to Detect and Estimate P-Hacking

Abstract: 
Results from empirical analyses can be forged with ease. Currently, such analyses are based on
the methodology of Null Hypothesis Significance Testing. Too often, conclusions are drawn solely
from the level of significance, also called the p-value. Scientists express concern about the ease at
which the p-value can be manipulated to support any result, conclusion and thus narrative. This
practice, called p-hacking leads to an inflation of false findings in the scientific literature. In the
long run, nothing less than the credibility of entire scientific domains is at stake. The debate on
how to properly adapt the scientific enterprise to the problem at hand has been going on for about
a century now. This thesis attempts to develop methods to detect p-hacking, and to estimate the
extent to which single p-hacking techniques can distort significance levels. The simulations presented
indicate that any finding can be labelled as statistically significant. Using real world data, it will
furthermore be demonstrated, how the current practise of empirical analysis and communicating
findings allows to almost fully disguise p-hacking. These results can help to identify the potential of
individual proposed solutions, which are also discussed here. Furthermore, the results underline the
urgency for the debate on solutions to reach consensus soon.
